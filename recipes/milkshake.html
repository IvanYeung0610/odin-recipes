        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Maraschino cherry (optional)</li>
            <li>Sprinkles or crushed cookies (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Check the consistency and add a splash more milk if it’s too thick, then blend again briefly.</li>
            <li>Pour the milkshake into a tall glass.</li>
            <li>Top with whipped cream, a maraschino cherry, and sprinkles or crushed cookies if desired.</li>
