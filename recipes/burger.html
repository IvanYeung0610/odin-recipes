        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Burger buns</li>
            <li>Slices of Cheese</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Red onion slices</li>
            <li>Pickes</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Form the patties by dividing the ground beef into 4 equal portions. Gently shape each portion into a patty about ¾ inch thick. Make a small indent in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up while cooking.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of each patty generously with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties on the grill or skillet for about 3–4 minutes on the first side, without pressing down. Flip and cook for another 3–4 minutes for medium doneness. Adjust timing for your preferred level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Add cheese: In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and cover with a lid or foil to help it melt.</li>
            <li>Toast the buns: While the patties are cooking, lightly butter the cut sides of the burger buns and toast them on the grill or in a pan until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burgers: Spread your preferred sauces (ketchup, mustard, mayo) on the buns, then layer the lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and onions as desired. Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun and top with the other half.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your favorite side dishes like fries, chips, or salad.</li>
        </ol>
